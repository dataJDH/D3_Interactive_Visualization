# D3_Interactive_Visualization
Line chart with interactive bar chart displays based on point selection.

The dataset contains the earthquake counts by U.S. state and region, in the years 2010 to 2015 (inclusively).

The code displays the count of earthquakes by region for each year in a line chart. Each line uses a different color, a legend shows the region for each color.

By Mouseover, the graph shows a horizontal bar chart, with one bar per state in the selected region. Each bar represents the count of earthquakes for one state in the selected year.

All axes automatically adjust based on the data. 

The D3 library is provided in the lib folder.
